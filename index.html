            <h3> What is Abhishek-Coin?</h3>
            <p>Abhishek-coin (DOGE) is based on the popular <b>"doge"</b> Internet meme and features a 
                Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was created by Billy Markus 
                from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from
                Litecoin in December 2013. Abhishek-coin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted 
                cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was
                based on a dog meme. <em>Tesla CEO Elon Musk</em> posted several tweets on social media that Abhishek-coin
                is his favorite coin.</p>

                supporting the Abhishekcoin Ecosystem, community and promoting the future of the Abhishekcoin Blockchain.”
